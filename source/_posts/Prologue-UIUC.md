UIUC is a prestigious research university in the US.
My friends (Mickey, Cosmos) and I are incoming exchange students and about to live a full semester here. Let's see what heppened in the first week before lectures begin.

### Cooking

Food price in US is way much more expensive than it was in Taiwan. So we usually cook for our self.
