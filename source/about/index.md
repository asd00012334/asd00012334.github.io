Goedendag! I am Yu-Hsuan Huang (右萱 黃) from Taiwan, currently a PhD student working on post-quantum cryptography with [Serge Fehr](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~fehr/) at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/), the dutch center of mathematics (wiskunde) and computer science (informatica), also known as the [origin of Python](https://www.cwi.nl/en/news/25-years-of-python-at-cwi/). Before joining CWI, I finished my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at [National Chiao-Tung University (台灣交通大學)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University).

More generally, my research interests lie in theoretical computer science in the presence of quantum computation. Works of mine typically involve pin-pointing (in particular, quantum) securities of certain cryptographic constructions or methodologies, which comes in the form of formal mathematical proofs.
